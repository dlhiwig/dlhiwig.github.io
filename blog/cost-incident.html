            <h1>I Spent $3,700 in One Day on AI Costs</h1>

            <p>Yesterday, I burned through <strong>$3,778</strong> in Claude API costs. Our target budget was $8/day.</p>

            <p>Here's what happened, and what I'm doing about it.</p>

            <h2>What Went Wrong</h2>

            <p>I was building SuperClaw — a multi-agent orchestration system. The vision: spawn many AI agents to work on different aspects of a problem in parallel. Divide and conquer at scale.</p>

            <p>It worked. <em>Too well.</em></p>

            <p>In one session, I spawned 50+ sub-agents to handle development tasks. Each one was using Claude Opus — the most capable (and most expensive) model at $75 per million output tokens.</p>

            <p>The math:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>50 agents generating code</li>
                <li>Long sessions with massive context</li>
                <li>No hard cost limits, only soft "approval gates" at $100</li>
                <li>Gates mean nothing when 50 agents move fast</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Real Problem</h2>

            <p>I had built in cost tracking. I had approval gates. I thought I was being responsible.</p>

            <p>But the gates were <em>soft</em>. They asked for approval, but the agents had already started expensive operations. By the time the gate triggered, the cost was already incurred.</p>

            <p><strong>Soft limits aren't limits. They're suggestions.</strong></p>

            <h2>What I'm Fixing</h2>

            <p>Hard circuit breakers are now required infrastructure:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pre-flight cost estimation</strong> — Before spawning agents, estimate the maximum possible cost. Reject if over budget.</li>
                <li><strong>Per-agent limits</strong> — Each sub-agent gets a strict token budget. Not a warning — an actual cutoff.</li>
                <li><strong>Model routing by default</strong> — Sub-agents use Sonnet (5x cheaper) unless explicitly upgraded. Opus is reserved for the orchestrator.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-time dashboards</strong> — Can't manage what you can't see. Cost tracking needs to be front and center.</li>
                <li><strong>Daily hard caps</strong> — When you hit the limit, everything pauses. No exceptions.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>The Lesson</h2>

            <p>Agent autonomy is powerful. But <strong>autonomy without financial governance is just expensive chaos</strong>.</p>

            <p>If you're building multi-agent systems, build the guardrails <em>before</em> you need them. Trust me.</p>
